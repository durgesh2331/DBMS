To determine the candidate keys, we need to find the minimal sets of attributes whose closure contains all attributes of R(A, B, C, D, E, H).

Step 1: Given Functional Dependencies (FDs)
A → B
BC → D
E → C
D → A
Step 2: Finding the Closure of a Potential Key
To be a candidate key, a set must determine all attributes (A, B, C, D, E, H).

Finding A⁺ (Closure of A)
A → B (Add B)
We cannot determine C, D, or E, so A alone is not a candidate key.
Finding AE⁺
A → B (Add B)
E → C (Add C)
BC → D (Since we have B and C, add D)
D → A (A is already there)
Now, we have {A, B, C, D, E}, but we are missing H.
To cover H, we add H → AEH.

Finding BE⁺
E → C (Add C)
BC → D (Since we have B and C, add D)
D → A (Add A)
A → B (B is already there)
Now, we have {A, B, C, D, E}, but we are missing H.
To cover H, we add H → BEH.

Finding DE⁺
D → A (Add A)
A → B (Add B)
E → C (Add C)
BC → D (D is already there)
Now, we have {A, B, C, D, E}, but we are missing H.
To cover H, we add H → DEH.

Step 3: Identifying the Minimal Keys
Now we have three minimal sets whose closure gives all attributes:

AEH
BEH
DEH
Thus, the candidate keys are AEH, BEH, and DEH.

Final Answer:
✅ Option (D) AEH, BEH, DEH




Step 1: Identify the Candidate Keys
From our previous solution, the candidate keys of the relation R(A, B, C, D, E, H) are:

AEH
BEH
DEH
Step 2: Super Key Definition
A super key is any superset of a candidate key. This means that we can form super keys by adding extra attributes from the relation R(A, B, C, D, E, H).

Step 3: Compute Super Keys
Each candidate key can form super keys by adding any subset of the remaining attributes that are not already included.

The total number of super keys for a candidate key X is given by:

Total Super Keys

∑
𝐾

(

𝐾

)
Total Super Keys=

∑
​

(n−∣K∣)
 
where:

n = total number of attributes in the relation (6: A, B, C, D, E, H).
|K| = size of the candidate key (here, 3 for AEH, BEH, and DEH).
Remaining attributes = 
6

6−3=3 (since candidate keys already contain 3 attributes, the remaining ones can either be included or not).
Each candidate key can generate

 =8 super keys (by including or excluding the remaining attributes).
Since we have 3 candidate keys, the total number of super keys is:
